### This is an implementation of a TINY interpreter in Racket. The TINY language is a simplified version of a programming language that only supports four arithmetic operators and if-then-else and while statements. The interpreter takes in a TINY program as input and produces the corresponding output by evaluating the statements in the program. The interpreter works by parsing the program into statements and expressions, and then executing the statements in sequence, updating the environment with each statement's results. Finally, the interpreter evaluates the expression that corresponds to the output statement and displays the result.

The code defines several functions:

- report-no-binding-found - This function is called when the interpreter tries to apply a variable that is not bound in the current environment. It throws an error message.

- report-invalid-env - This function is called when the interpreter tries to apply an invalid environment. It throws an error message.

- empty-env - This function creates an empty environment.

- extend-env - This function extends an environment with a new variable and its corresponding value.

- apply-env - This function applies a variable in the environment to its corresponding value.

- interpreter - This function is the main function of the interpreter. It takes a TINY program as input and interprets it by calling the process function.

- process - This function takes a list of TINY statements and an environment as input and executes each statement in sequence.

- interp - This function takes a TINY statement and an environment as input and executes the statement, updating the environment with any new variable bindings.

- exp - This function takes a TINY expression and an environment as input and evaluates the expression to produce a value.
