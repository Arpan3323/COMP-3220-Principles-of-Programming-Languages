<h1>Homework 4</h1>
 <p1>TinyParser.rb was modified to print abstract syntax trees(in list form) whenever it reads a file that was written in tiny language(.tiny). These abstract syntax trees are then supposed to be read by an interpreter to recognize the order of execution and finally execute and run .tiny files.</p1>
 <br>
 <p1>The methods used to create the nodes of abstract syntax tree are defined in AST.rb. The toStringList() method in AST.rb coverts the trees into a list form before they are printed out</p1>
